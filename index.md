   I am a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Manning College of Information & Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. I am advised by  <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~rahimi/">Prof. Negin Rahimi</a>. My broad research interests are primarily in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Prior to this, I received a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Kharagpur, India where I worked on the paradigm of tool-augmentation for mathematical reasoning in LLMs, supervised by <a href="https://adityasomak.github.io/">Prof. Somak Aditya</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    My current research interests are focused on the effective utilization of retrieval-based systems and external structured knowledge to improve multiple reasoning dimensions in language models. My other interests revolve around the use of neuro-symbolic methods in NLP, and trying to make LLMs safer to use in social contexts.
