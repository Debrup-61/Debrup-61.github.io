I am Debrup Das, a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the [Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), UMass Amherst. I am advised by [Prof. Negin Rahimi](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~rahimi/). My broad research interests are primarily in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Prior to this, I received a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters) in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Kharagpur, India where I worked on the paradigm of tool-augmentation for mathematical reasoning in LLMs, supervised by [Prof. Somak Aditya](https://adityasomak.github.io/). 


My current research interests are focused on the effective utilization of retrieval-based systems and external structured knowledge to improve multiple reasoning dimensions in language models. My other interests revolve around the use of neuro-symbolic methods in NLP, and trying to make LLMs safer to use in social contexts.
